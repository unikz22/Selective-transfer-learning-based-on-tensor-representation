# Selective-transfer-learning-based-on-tensor-representation
1)environment configuration: miney.1.2.6 , tensorly 
2)dataset introduction: XJTU-SY dataset and PHM Challenge 2012 dataset (we only use the fast degradation data)
3)dataset includes reading data, making labels and dividing data
4)model includes based model(LSTM,CNN...), deal parameters and transferibility calculation
5)run Classifier.pyï¼Œtraining a class model
6)run prelstm.py,  it is a main code
